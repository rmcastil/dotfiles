# dotfiles
My dotfiles built from the ground up. Several of the things that I use:
* NVIM as my VIM editor.
* Zsh as my shell.
* Brew as my package manager.
* asdf as my tool manager (rubies, nodes, etc).

## Setup
Run and see `bin/setup` for getting everything up and running with a new Mac. It will
* link dotfiles to the home directory.
* install xcode-select.
* install homebrew.
* install homebrew packages.
* install nvim and instructions for installing vim plugins.
